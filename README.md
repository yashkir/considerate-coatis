# Considerate Coatis Python 2021 Summer Code Jam

## Overview

The theme of the Code Jam was "Think Inside The Box" so we decided on
making a game where you have to fit in. The premise is that you are
an alien in a human high school and you must make choices that prevent
you from standing out.

## Technologies

- Python
- Urwid (TUI)

## Getting Started

Do the usual Python dance:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Start the thing:
```
python main.py
```
Start a new game. You will be presented with events in turn. Select a
response and keep an eye on your stats. You must avoid your `sus` or
`sadness` getting too high, which happens if your stats are either too
high or too low.

## Next Steps

- high score list
- more story
- different locations
